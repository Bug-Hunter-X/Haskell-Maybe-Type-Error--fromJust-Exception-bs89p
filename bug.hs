This Haskell code attempts to perform an unsafe operation on a Maybe value without proper handling of the Nothing case.  The `fromJust` function throws an exception if the Maybe value is Nothing. 
```haskell
import Data.Maybe

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let x = Just 5
      y = Nothing
  print $ fromJust x  -- Safe
  print $ fromJust y  -- ERROR: throws exception
```
