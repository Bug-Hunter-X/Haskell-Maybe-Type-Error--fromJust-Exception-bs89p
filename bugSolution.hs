This corrected Haskell code safely handles the Maybe type using pattern matching.  It provides default values or alternative logic for the Nothing case.
```haskell
main :: IO ()
main = do
  let x = Just 5
      y = Nothing
  print $ case x of
            Just val -> val
            Nothing -> 0  -- Default value for Nothing
  print $ case y of
            Just val -> val
            Nothing -> 0  -- Default value for Nothing

  -- Alternative using maybe
  print $ maybe 0 id x
  print $ maybe 0 id y
```
